# V-plus-plus
A simple, English-like programming language, with relaxed syntax, C bindings, and the ability to use Node packages. 

# Prerequisites

In order to run V++ from a Github clone, you REQUIRE the following:

- A version of the GNU compiler for C files. 
- A version of Mono in order to run C# .exe files, OR a Windows system.
- The git command-line tool (how else are you going to clone the folder?!)

The following is highly recommended but not strictly mandatory:

- Node.js (with the Node Package Manager) 

You need this if you plan on using Node dependencies. Just go to https://nodejs.org/en/, or download from @nodejs/node at Github.

- MyV++ 

The superlative IDE for V++. Why use anything else? Installable binaries available at V++ framework website.

- The V++ app-builder CLI 

You need this if you are planning to build apps. @VedaantS/AppsVpp should do the trick, or again, you can just get binaries from the abovementioned website.

- The V++ Game Engine

You need this if you are planning on using V++ for game development. @VedaantS/GameVpp, or binaries from website. 

# Setup + Installation

This folder has all the source code necessary to download and setup the V++ language. V++, or the standard version at least, operates using a virtual machine, which itself is written using C with a layer of C# on top. 

Go into your terminal and clone this. Then, cd into it, and type into your terminal "sh setup.sh". And that's it! You're good! All the C files should delete for you. You can now use V-flat and V++ freely.
